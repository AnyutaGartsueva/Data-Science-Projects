Title: Best English Learning Applications Analytics (My very first Data Science Project)

Description: Identifies the most popular apps for learning English 
(according to rating, number of installations and a price impact on it). 
The author focuses more on drafting than on detailed analysis.
Virtual environment had not been created for this project before programming it.
The requirements.txt may contain extra modules and dependencies.

Installation: 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can also install all the required dependencies using Windows PowerShell or PyCharm instead of Bash. 

Applying: 
1. Create a json file with your own credentials using your Google Cloud account;
2. Create a Google Spreadsheet, connect it to your project to upload the received information about the best English learning apps;
3. Specify the Path to your json file instead of #hereshouldbeyourcredentials#.
4. Run the code

```bash
python EngAppAnalytics/main.py
```


You are also welcome to look through the EngAppAnalytics.xlsx file to see the information the author got after running this code.
You can find all the graphs those were produced by the program in the directory named "Graphics"
